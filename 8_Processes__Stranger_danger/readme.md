# 8. Processes - Stranger danger

Processes are another important element of Linux that I have never gotten around to learning.
Like many other subjects I have covered here, it turned out to be fairly intuitive.
[This](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/processes-in-linuxunix/) article was really easy to understand.

I was contemplating for a while what kind of project I could create but ultimately came up with a command that prints all processes that donâ€™t belong to you or root.
That way, you can keep a close eye on who is creating processes.
Note, there are many legitimate reasons that other users would run processes on your system, and it rarely means someone has gained access to your computer.
