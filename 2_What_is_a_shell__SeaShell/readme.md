# 2. What is a shell? - SeaShell

For this project, I was curious to find out what exactly a shell was.
Even though it is something that I use often, I was still confused about what differentiates it from the terminal.
Turns out it’s really not that complicated.
I learned this by rereading the *shell* part of [the paper](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf) from the previous project, and some explanations online like [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-what-is-shell.htm ) and [this one](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php ).
The Unix shell Wikipedia entry was also very informative.

Since this project is about the shell, I found it appropriate to try and write my own.
I settled on the name *SeaShell*, which I found way too funny.
It’s not very advanced, but it does the job.
