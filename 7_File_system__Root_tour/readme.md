# 7. File system - Root tour

Ever since I executed my first *ls /* I have wondered what all those directories were for.
Time to unveil the mystery.
The first thing I did was read [this](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-filesystem-explained/) article as it explained each directory in root and provided a nice graph.
[This](https://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/sect_03_01.html) resource was also nice since it had a table that summed up each directory in one or two sentences.

The project ended up being a program that gives you descriptions for directories in your own root folder.
