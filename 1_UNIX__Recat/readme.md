# 1. UNIX - Recat

The first thing I wanted to learn more about was UNIX since Linux is a UNIX-like operating system.
I also never really felt that I fully understood what exactly UNIX was, besides being a family of fairly similar operating systems.

The first thing I did was to read the entire Wikipedia page on UNIX.
I also read [this](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brewer/cs262/unix.pdf) original paper written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson from 1974, which was really interesting though I canâ€™t say I understood all of it.
After some more reading and some Youtube videos, I felt comfortable that I understood what UNIX was, and what makes it interesting.

For the project, I decided to try and write my first C program.
Following the Unix philosophy, I made sure that it did one thing only.
That thing ended up being a program that reverses the contents of a text file.
Since this is just a reverse version of *cat*, I called the program *recat*.
