# 3. Ownership and permissions - Tellaccess

This is one of the things that I know is really important for Linux, but have never really understood.
I have tried before but never been able to get the knowledge to stick, maybe because I didn't really care about security until now.

The ownership and permission system turned out to be really intuitive, and I was able to understand the basics from [this](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/understanding-basic-file-permissions-and-ownership-in-linux/) one article.
I later discovered [this one](https://linuxhandbook.com/linux-file-permissions/) from Linux Handbook which was more comprehensive.

For the project, I decided to create a program that tells you in human-readable form, the ownership and permissions of a file.
I called the project *tellaccess* because it tells you who can access the file in what ways.
