# 4. Grep - Grep detective

Grep is the sort of UNIX magic I have always wanted to learn.
Since *grep* is all about regular expressions I would have to learn that first.
This was actually quite difficult because grep uses the *POSIX Basic Regular Expressions*, which is not that common.
The [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX_Basic_Regular_Expressions) was a lifesaver.
Besides that, I also used the man page for *grep* as a reference.

For the project, I thought that a fun idea might be to create a detective game.
In the game, you get a folder full of files, and itâ€™s your job to extract information.
I called the game *Grep detective*.
