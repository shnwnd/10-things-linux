# 6. Find - Find treasure hunt

Another important tool I never really got around to learning.
Learning how to use *find* was fairly easy, it was mostly about memorizing the different flags, and the format you set the flags in.
I used [this](https://kb.iu.edu/d/admm) as a reference.

For the project, I created a treasure hunt where you look for clues in files with different attributes.
I first wrote a script that created a bunch of small files and directories as noise.
Then a selected few of the files got clues to the whereabouts of the other ones.
In the end, you find the treasure, which I wonâ€™t tell you what is.
